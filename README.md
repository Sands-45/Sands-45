“Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming: feedback is the treatment. “ Kent Beck<br>
I'm a passionate programmer who loves data and problem-solving.I've been doing this for a while now and not planning to stop. I've gained so much experience and knowledge over the past years working as a QA to Performance analyst, seeing the need and some gaps or insufficiencies in tools used I've became an innovative programmer and a problem solver through data and some coding of cause.

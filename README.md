# About </h2>

<h2> My Portfolio </h2>

“Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming: feedback is the treatment. “ Kent Beck<br>
I'm a passionate programmer who loves data and problem-solving.My journey started back 2018 using no-code tools/softwares but with limitation and the eager to learn I decided to learn and do it the hard way. I've gained so much experience and knowledge over the past years working as a QA to Performance analyst, seeing the need and some gaps or insufficiencies in tools used I've became an innovative programmer and a problem solver.
